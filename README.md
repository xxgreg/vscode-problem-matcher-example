I'm trying to figure out why nothing appears in my problems panel when I run the "make an error" task.

This is defined in '.vscode/tasks.json'.

I've followed the documentation here:
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks#_defining-a-problem-matcher

But I'm obviously doing something wrong. Any ideas?
